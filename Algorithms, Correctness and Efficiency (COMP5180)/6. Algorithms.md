#### Reduction
- Solving a problem by using an already existing solution to another problem.
- Accept the existing solution as black-box - as long as it is correct.
- Correctness of outer solution does not depend on the inner solution.
- The complexity around using the inner solution.


#### Recursion
- "self reduction?" - *that's just fucking retarded*
- must have a termination condition.

##### Tower on Hanoi
```
Function TowerOfHanoi(height, from, to)

if(height = 1) just move the disk

free = determine free peg somehow

TowerOfHanoi(height – 1, from, free)

move disk #height from peg #from to peg #to

TowerOfHanoi(height – 1, free, to)

end
```


### Recursion Trees
It's what you think they are


#### Time complexity of a recursive function
```
T(n)   =   f(n)   +   r * f(n/c)   +   r2 * f(n/c2)   +   ………   +   rL * f(n/cL)
```
