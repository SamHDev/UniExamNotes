A binary heap is a special type of binary tree (organised differently to a binary search tree) that is easier to store as an array

Binary tree such that each parent element is larger than its two children. Thus, largest element at root. Represent as an array (NB indices start at 1)

- Easy to get from vertex to child/parent
	- `Parent of vertex k in positionÂ  k / 2`
	- `Children of vertex k in positions 2k, 2k + 1`

> **THE CONDITION**
> **`Parent(i).value > i.value`**

#### Insert
1. Add new node to end of list
2. Keep exchanging with parent if parent is smaller
3. HEAPIFY UP!

#### Remove
1. Overwriting element to be removed with the last item in the heap
2. Then move down heap restoring heap condition
3. HEAPIFY DOWN!

#### Heap-Sort
- First build the heap by inserting items one at a time, then one-by-one, remove the maximum element in the heap and heapify
