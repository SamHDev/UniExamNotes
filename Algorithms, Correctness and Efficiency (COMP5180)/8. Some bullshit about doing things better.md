- Introducing new termination conditions
	**Pros**
	- Faster computations for large values of n
	- Easy to implement
	**Cons**
	- Limited effect
	- Still `O(2^n)`
	- Have to check all termination conditions at every call
- Change the recursion formula
	**Pros**
	- Better recursive formula
	- Affects all values of n
	- L gets smaller since some levels of recursion are skipped
- Memorisation (Caching)
	**Pros**
	- Usually easy to implement
	- `O(n)
	- No redundant calls
	**Cons**
	- Storing results takes up memory
	- Searching for old results can be time-consuming in big tasks
