`flexible` vs `fixed`

1. Store the data
2. Access data
3. Manipulate data
4. Use memory effectively


#### Flexible
- Made up of pointers
- Adding further data and more "tiles"
- pro: easy to move, flexible shape
- con: not very data efficient

#### Fixed
- Rigid Structures
- Need to know offsets
- Modifying data may result in clone & destroy
- pro: Efficient use of memory
- con: no substructures


#### Dynamic Arrays
- actual array that contains the data
- an index that has the next free cell
- some given capacity

1. a bigger array is created
2. data is copied
3. array becomes the internal array

> Cells are copied, on average, 3 times
> `1/(1 - 1/k)
