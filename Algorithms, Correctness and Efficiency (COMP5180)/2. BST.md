### Binary Search Trees
#### Ordering
##### In-order
1. visit left-most
2. visit root
3. visit right-most

##### Pre-Order
1. visit root
2. visit left-most
3. visit right-most

##### Post-Order
1. visit left-most
2. visit right-most
3. visit root

- The algorithms to search, traverse and insert in a tree move one step down the tree at each iteration
- Means that the time taken is limited by the height of the tree
- The amount of data stored in a tree (its size) is the number of nodes

### Hash Tables.
- Hash tables are **potentially faster**.
- Lookup table where speed is very important.
- trade-off between table size and speed

### Balancing

- A tree is said to be balanced if the height of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1
- assume the height of an empty tree is -1

- `height of tree = h`
- `n (#of nodes) = 2^(h+1) â€“ 1`

#### Complete Trees
- a binary tree with all the levels except the last filled.
- All the leaves in the last level to the left side

all complete binary trees are balanced, but not all balanced tress are complete.



#### AVL Trees
- the left and right tress have at most a height difference of one
- this is valid for all subtrees

rotate a tree by its pivot node


##### Red-Black Trees
- nodes are red or black
- root is always black
- null leaves of tree is black
- if a node is red, then it's children are black
- any path most go through the same number of black nodes


AVL allows more nodes, but requires extra computation. 
RBs allow for better performance, but reduce the capacity per tree height.
