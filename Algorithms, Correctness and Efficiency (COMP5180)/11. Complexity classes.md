### Decision problems.
Decision problems are problems that can give a yes or no answer for a particular question
- Search problems
- Path finding problems
- Satisfiability problems
- Etc.

### P vs NP

- Running time of an efficient algorithm should be bounded by a polynomial function of its input size


##### P...
P is a class of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time:
- Comparing two numbers
- Evaluating a set of conditions
- Binary search on an array
- Determining is a number is prime (shown in 2002)
- Etc.

##### NP...
NP is a set of all decision problems for which if the answer is yes, the corresponding solution (proof) can be verified in polynomial time
- Satisfiability problem
- Sum of subset problem
- Binary search on an array
- Determining if a number is prime

##### co-NP...
co-NP is a set of all decision problems for which if the answer is no, the corresponding solution (proof) can be verified in polynomial time

- Which ones are co-NP here?
- Satisfiability problem
- Sum of subset problem
- Binary search on an array
- Determining if a number is prime

##### EXP... 
EXP is a set of all decision problems that can be solved in exponential time, e.g. O(2n)

- Satisfiability problem
- Most path-finding algorithms
- Sum of subset
- Tower of Hanoi
- All P problems


### How to prove P vs NP
> P ⊆ NP
> Because we can check the solution for a polynomial problem by computing the answer again, which can be done in polynomial time

> P ⊆ co-NP
> Because we can verify that a polynomial decision problem has no solutions in polynomial time

- Some problems are both NP and co-NP
- All polynomial classes are contained within the EXP class

### NP-Hard
NP-hard is a class of problems which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP

Includes problems that are in NP but not in P:
- Travelling salesman problem
- Sum of subset problem

Includes problems that are not in NP
- Tower of Hanoi problem

Includes undecidable problems

#### NP-Complete

NP-complete is a class of decision problems which contains the hardest problems in NP

All NP-hard problems in NP

### Determining complexity class of a problem
| Class | Method |
| ----- | ------ |
| P | Create a polynomial-time solution to the problem |
| NP | Create a polynomial-time evaluator for a positive solution |
| co-NP | Create a polynomial-time evaluator for a negative solution |
| NP-hard | Proof by enumeration - Reduce every known NP-problem to the new problem |
| | Reduce to a known NP-hard problem - •If the problem can be reduced to an NP-hard problem than it has to be at least NP-hard |
| NP-complete | Show that a problem is NP and NP-hard |
