- Classify and order functions
- predict a runtime of a program

> parametric program: program that takes parameters


#### Objections
- depends on hardware
- runtimes can change
- programs can be non-deterministic when using:
	- concurrency
	- random numbers


#### Maths Shit
`O(a) + O(b) = O(a + b)`
