- Infinite tape, containing input word and blanks.
- A head sits on this tape, it can move left or right.
- This head reads and writes to the tape.

Each transition reads, writes then moves.
- The notation is `read/write/move`
- To keep the value the same, write the existing value.

The tape has "special" accept and reject states, that apply immediately.

When writing turning computations:
```
<before> [<position> <value>] <after>

Example:

_abaa__...      1abba
 ^
_xbaa__...      x2bba
  ^  
```


- For a given word a Turing machine may accept the word, reject the word or loop.

- A Turing machine decides a language, if it accepts every word of the language and rejects all other words.
- A language that is decided by some Turing machine is called Turing-decidable


- A Turing machine recognises a language, if it accepts every word of the language and does not accept any other words.
- A language that is recognised by some Turing machine is called Turing-recognisable.

### Encodings
Pairs could be encoded as: 
```
(1010101, 1100)

1010101$1100

(where $ is some new character)
```

Data can also be encoded as a single world:
- the full contents of one database
- a graph
- computer mem


### Functions
- consider content of tape when machine reaches halting state: output
- For input that makes the machine loop, the function is not defined (partial).
- A function is called computable if there exists a Turing machine that computes it.

### Enumerators
- a Turing machine that can print from tape to a separate "printer"

### Universal Turing Machine
$$ \displaylines {
\text {Let M be a Turing machine and w a word.} \\

U = \text{Given<U, M>} \\
\text{U is the universal Turing machine.} \\
\\
\text {Because M may loop, U may loop.} \\
L = \text{\{ <M,w> | M is Turing machine that accepts w \}}
\\



}
$$

The language recognised by the universal Turing machine is undecidable.
