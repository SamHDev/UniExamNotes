- Specification of base relations/tables
- Analysis of transactions
- Choice of physical representation
- Security measures

**Database designers should be aware of**
1. Transaction requirements
	**Frequency**
	how many transactions are to be expected per second
	
	**Volume**
	how many transactions are to be execute overall
	
	**Type of access**
	Mostly reading, mostly updating, mostly inserting data?
	What is the mix of accesses?
	
2. How system resources affect DB performance
	- Main memory: sufficient to avoid or minimize swapping
	- CPU: have enough and fast enough cores to cope with the number of queries
	- Disk Access: accessing secondary storage is slow, a major bottleneck
	- Storage: 
		- OS
		- main database files
		- index files
		- log files


##### Goals of Optimization

- Throughput should be as fast as possible
- Response time should be “acceptably” fast
- Disk storage should be minimized
- Objectives may conflict:
	physical design needs to consider tradeoffs


##### File Storage

- In a database, data are organized as a collection of rows/records that are stored either in OS files or managed by DBMS
- Each file contains one or more rows/records usually belonging to a single table
- Each record consists of one or more column

- OS transfers blocks of data between the secondary storage and the buffer in the main memory
- DBMS read/write pages from/to the buffer
- Typically, a page consists of several OS blocks
- Number of rows per page
	- Size of row
	- fixed or of variable length
	- records be partitioned across pages (spanned)


- Heap (unordered) files
	Records are placed on disk in insertion order, i.e. the order in which they are added to the table, which is considered unordered
	
	- Insertion is efficient
	- Retrieval is inefficient as search is linear from start
	- Deletion leaves space between records
	
- Sequential (ordered) files
	Records are placed on disk in order of the value of a specified field
	
	- Very rarely used for database storage
	- Efficient retrieval of records containing a specific value or a range of values
	- Problematic in insertion and deletion
	
- Hash files
	Records are placed on disk into buckets or pages according to a hash function
	
	- Within each page or bucket, multiple records are stored in slots in the order of arrival
	- The base field is termed as hash field, or hash key if the field is the key field of the file
	- Techniques to spread hashes evenly across address space
	  
	- Efficient for exact matches on key field
	- Not suitable for:
		- Pattern matching
		- sequential storage
		- Retrieval of alternative fields/columns
		- Searches on fields other than key field have to be linear


### Indexes.
- Indexes can make searching and retrieval of data more efficient
- Indexes map a field value, with the address of the record


##### `B+-` Trees
- `B+-`Tree is a variant of balanced tree
- Dynamic multi-level index that expands or shrinks as rows are added or deleted
- Time taken to retrieve any row is the same as the same number of nodes searched, it’s fast and efficient

- B+-tree with each node containing two search key values and three pointers
- –The leaf nodes are often called “buckets”

> **Example: retrieve data record with the key ‘C05’**
> 
> 1. Start at the root node
> 2. As C05 < C11, follow the pointer to the left
> 3. As C05 is between C04 and C08, follow the pointer in the middle
> 4. C05 is found in the leaf node so the pointer to its left points


- Depth of a tree refers to the number of levels
- Degree or order of a tree refers to the number of child nodes allowed per parent node


- Indexes speed up performance because they store the values in a fast data structure
- Indexes are typically created automatically on primary keys
- Foreign key and ‘UNIQUE’ columns are often indexed
- Consider indexes whenever you have a column that is often in a ‘WHERE’ clause
