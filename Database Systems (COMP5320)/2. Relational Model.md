Relational Model – logical data model
- Definitions
- Domains
- Relationships and keys
- Integrity constraints

It consists of
- Data structures - Entities and their relations
- Data constraints - Restrictions on data, relations, …
- Relational operators - Restrict (select), project, Cartesian product, union, difference, …

Terminology
- Relation - Entity or class
	- Each relation is identified by a unique name
	- Order of attributes or tuples has no significance
- Tuple- Instance of an entity
	- a row of a relation
	- uniquely identified by one or more attributes
- Attribute- Descriptions of an entity
	- column of a relation
	- distinct name
	- must be atomic
- Relationship - Association between entities

### Keys
**Candidate key**
A minimal set of attributes which uniquely identifies each tuple

**Primary key**
The chosen candidate key to uniquely identify each tuple

**Alternate key**
The remaining candidate keys
If there are more than one candidate keys in a relation and one of these is chosen as the primary key, the remaining candidate keys are referred to as alternate keys

**Foreign key**
Attribute (or a set of attributes) that matches the candidate key of the associated relation
Used to represent the relationship between two relations

**Composite key**
Refers to a key consisting of two or more attributes


### Constraints.
**Entity integrity rule:** constraint on primary keys.
- Primary key must be unique
- not null

**Referential integrity rule:** constraint on foreign keys
- Value of a foreign key must either match the candidate key it refers to or be null


### Relational Algebra

##### Restrict (Select) - (`sigma`)
Defines horizontal subset of a relation

e.g. Identify all `male` `students`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM _table_ WHERE _condition_;
```

##### Project (`pi`)
Defines vertical partitioning of a relation

e.g. List `name` and `gender` of all `students`

```sql
SELECT _attr_, _attr_ FROM _table_;
```

#### Union (`v`)
Union combines two relations (tables)

```sql
SELECT * FROM _table1_
UNION
SELECT * FROM _table2_
```

##### Intersection (`^`)
Set intersection on relations - Only tuples contained in both.

e.g. List student `names` which are common in both `Student` and `PtStudent` relations

```sql
SELECT name FROM _table1_
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM _table2_
```

##### Difference (`-`)
Relation `T` contains all tuples which are in relation `R` but not in `S` (`T <- R - S`)

All duplicate tuples are eliminated so that the result relation R3 is valid

```sql
SELECT name FROM _table1_
MINUS
SELECT name FROM _table2_
```

##### Natural Join (`⋈`)
Cartesian product, removing common duplicated attributes

e.g. List students’ ID and name together with their course IDs and marks.

```
SELECT *FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

#### Outer Joins

##### Left Outer Join
- Includes all tuples from R1, even the unmatched ones
- Missing values of tuples from R2 are set to null

##### Right Outer Join
- Includes all tuples from R2, even the unmatched ones
- Missing values of tuples from R1 are set to null

##### Full Outer Join
- Includes all tuples from R1 and R2, even the unmatched ones
- Missing values are set to null
