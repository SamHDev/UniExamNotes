NoSQL - <u>N</u>ot <u>O</u>nly <u>SQL</u>

**NoSQL Types** 
- Key-Value Stores
- Wide Column Store
- Document Stores
- Object-Oriented Databases
- Graph Databases
- Search Based

**Features**
- Allows for less rigid structures
- Often lack ACID transactions
- Designed for the demands of distributed big data
- Replication and redundancy, possibly at both a distributed level and between records

### Key-Value Stores
- Data is in pairs, Key and Value
- Perhaps the simplest form of storage
- Atomic operations prevent concurrent write

##### Redis
- All data in memory
	- Speeds up read and write access considerably
	- Partitioning over multiple machines is one solution to RAM limits
- Master-replica distribution of databases
- Key ranges are distributed over machines
	replicas to compensate when master fails
- Command queues instead of transactions
- Atomic operations built in

```redis
SET account 36
GET account
INCR account

keys = KEYS(id*)

-- user:100 = {name:"foo"}
HSET user:100 name "foo"
HGETALL user:100
```


### Wide Column Stores
- Like SQL, tables are the main means of storage
- The first column of each table is a key
- Each row can have a different set of columns
- Rows, columns, or elements are often time-stamped to provide a temporal functionality

- Schema can be implicit
- No join support
- Distributed, asynchronous replication
- Original implementation was Google BigTable

#### Cassandra
- large data set for NoSQL
- architecture emphasizes distribution
	- Peer-to-peer (in contrast to master-replica)
	- improving scalability by adding nodes is relatively easy
- Any column can be indexed

- No native locking supported
	Changes logged at each node
- Tuneable consistency
	number of nodes required to respond to change can be modified
- Optimized hard disc access
	Avoids overwrites, so allowing sequential I/O

- Cassandra usually runs over a cluster of machines
	- A cluster is a container for a single keyspace
	- A keyspace is the outermost container for data
- Keyspace attributes
	- Replication factor - Number of nodes storing the same row
- The keyspace contains the column families (similar to table)


A column family is similar to a relational table, but with some differences
- Columns do not have to be defined by a schema
- Columns can be added or removed as required
- Each column family is sorted on one column.
- Column families can contain other column families
	This is nesting, so “tables” can contain “tables”

### Document Stores.
- Stores documents
	- semi-structured, hierarchical data
	- in a format such as JSON or XML
- Documents can be seen as SQL tables, but are significantly different
	- Each element in a document can have nested elements
	- Every document has a unique ID
- Schemas usually implicit
- Query language provides an API to access documents
	- range queries
	- regular expression searches
	- Path traversals

#### MongoDB
- Uses BSON, a binary version of JSON
- Allows the insertion of an arbitrary JSON document
	- Permitting queries against any of the elements

- Any field in a document can be indexed
- Replication by primary-secondary (master-replica) architecture
- Horizontal scaling by splitting up a collection of documents across a cluster of nodes

- Read/write locks at the global, database and collection levels
- Optimistic locking strategy at the document-level

### Search Engine Databases
- Data has limited, varying structure.
- Data is often documents.
- Often used for analytics applications.
	- Text Search
	- Complex Search Expressions
	- Ranking of Search Results
	- Data is highly indexed to improve performance


#### Splunk
- Proprietary software
- Analytics focus
	- Stores a wide variety of machine generated data
	- Automated indexing
	- Tools to search, analyse and visualize
	- Machine learning functionality
	- Supports temporal and geographic information
- Scale to 10s of Terabytes

- Distribution via indexer clusters
- An indexer is a Splunk instance that stores data (indexes data)
- An indexer cluster is a group of indexers with the same data
- Distributed processing is client-server

The processing model is
1. Import Data
2. Analyse
3. Report results

### Graph Databases
- Nodes are connected by edges
	- The emphasis is on storing connected data
- Queries via a Graph Query Language
	- Join free
	- Allows graph operations 
		- Path Finding
		- Community Detection 
		- Discovering clusters
		- Node importance measures, such as centrality


#### neo4j

- Schema optional - Metadata can be specified, but need not be
- Supports
	- ACID Transactions
	- indexing
	- Distribution by replication of the entire instance
	- The Cypher query language queries the graph
