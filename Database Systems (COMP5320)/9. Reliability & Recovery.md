### Reliability

**Possible failures include
- System crashes - Loss of main memory
- Hardware failure - Loss of database storage
- Natural disaster - Destruction of database system
- Human errors - Corruption or destruction ofÂ  data, hardware or software

**Reliability is achieved by:
- Minimizing.
	- Frequency of failures.
	- Side-effects.
- Maximizing.
	- Ability to recover.
- Primary Reliability 
	- Avoid single point of failure.
	- Hardware replication
	- Backup power sources
- Secondary reliability
	- Rigorously implemented operating procedures
	- Access controls
	- Reliable backup and recovery mechanisms (test that shit)


- Transaction Failure - Deadlock
- System Failure - Power Issues/Blackout
- Commination Failure - Network Issues
- Media Failure - Disk/Hardware Issues


### Recovery
- Ensure transactions are either completely executed or not at all (Atomicity)
- Ensure the changes from committed transactions are permanently stored (Durability)
- Guarantee database consistency
- Have minimal impact on normal processing

- Backup system - backup copies of database
- Logging facility - Keep track of database transactions
- Checkpoint facility - database updates on the secondary storage
- Recovery manager - Restore database to a consistent state in the event of failures

#### Buffer Manager
- Pages fetched from disk as required
- Pages removed when no longer required
- Modified pages are flushed to disk at the end of a transaction or when buffer is full

#### Log-based Recovery
- Normal recovery - After normal shutdown
	- Start from last log record
- Warm recovery - After system failure
	- Revert to last checkpoint in log
	- Apply committed transactions
	- Remove effects of uncommitted transactions
- Cold recovery - After media failure
	- Restore from backup/dump
	- Apply log records to reach latest consistent state
  

#### Undo/Redo Algorithm
- Allows buffer manager to flush modified pages before, during or after commit
- Optimal for normal processing
- expensive in terms of recovery

1. Create two empty lists: UNDO and REDO
2. Start reading log at last checkpoint
3. Put all active transactions on the UNDO list
4. Read Log
	`If BEGIN-TRANSACTION found`
	  `Add transaction to UNDO list
	`If COMMIT found
		`Remove transaction from UNDO list
		`Add transaction to REDO list
5. 
   - Use before-images to undo all on the UNDO list
   - Use after-images to redo all on the REDO list
