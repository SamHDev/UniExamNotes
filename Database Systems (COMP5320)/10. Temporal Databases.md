Temporal databases provide a way to deal with historical data

In a temporal database:
- No data is deleted on DELETE or overwritten on UPDATE
- That is, past, current, and future data are all stored in the database

- Past data persists as tuple/attribute (row/column) versions
- Past data can be accessed by temporal queries
- Tuples or attributes have hidden timestamps associated with them to keep track of past, current, or future database states.

#### Time Shizz
- User Time
	- General use of temporal attributes
	- e.g. date_of_birth
- Valid Time.
	- time period during which the data values, i.e. ‘facts’, was/is/will be true (i.e., valid) in the modelled world.
	- E.g., credit card valid date: 01/20 to 01/25
- Transaction Time.
	- time period during which data values are stored in the database
	- Before and up to the current date, but not beyond the current date
	- stored using hidden timestamps in the database


### Transaction Time Databases
- Each record is extended with a transaction time interval
- Updates can be made only to the current state
- Sometimes also called ‘Rollback’ database.

> Requires `tstart` and `tend` to be stored
> future times are `UC` (Until changed) or `Null`

Use `DO INSTEAD rules`
```postgresql
CREATE RULE RULE_NAME AS
ON UPDATE|INSERT|DELETE TO VIEW_NAME
DO INSTEAD (
 -- ... --
)
```
