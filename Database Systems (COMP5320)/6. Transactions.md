- A transaction is a unit of work
- an action, or a series of actions

- A transaction has one of the two outcomes
	- A transaction is committed and database reaches a new consistent state
	- Transaction is aborted/rolled back and database must be restored to its consistent state before it started
- Committed transactions cannot be aborted
- Aborted transactions that are rolled back can be restarted later

```postgresql
BEGIN

-- .... --
-- cmds --
-- .... --

COMMIT
-- or --
ROLLBACK
```


### ACID
- **A**tomicity
	A transaction is either completed or aborted
- **C**onsistency
	If a database is in a consistent state before a transaction,  it should in a consistent state after a transaction
- **I**solation
	Partial effects of incomplete transactions should not be visible to other transactions
- Durability
	Once a transaction is committed,  its effects must be permanent


### Transaction Issues
- System failure
	- hardware
	- software
	- network
	- DBMS must return database to a consistent state after such a disaster!
- Concurrent transaction problems
	- multiple users to access the common database at the same time
	- multiple transactions concurrently
	  
	- Lost updates (dirty write)
	- Reading uncommitted data (dirty read)
	- Non-repeatable read (inconsistent analysis)



### Schedules
- A schedule is a sequence of operations by a set of concurrent transactions.
- The order of each transaction is preserved
- Operations from different transactions may be interleaved

###### Serial Schedules
- Each transaction commits before the next one is allowed to run
- No concurrency issues
- But poor throughput and response time

###### Serializable Schedule
- when interleaved actions produce exactly the same results as a serial schedule, i.e., one transaction after the other.

### Concurrency Control

##### Locks
A transaction uses locks to deny access to other transactions in preventing incorrect updates
To access a data item, e.g. a row, a transaction must first acquire a lock on that data item

- Read Lock – Shared lock
- Write Lock – Exclusive lock manager maintains list of locks

**Potential problems**
- Deadlock
	two or more transactions, each waiting for another to release its lock
- Livelock
	Transactions waits indefinitely for a lock despite being rolled back repeatedly


##### Timestamping
- Timestamping is another way to eliminate conflicts
- No locking, so no deadlock!

- Each transaction T gets a timestamp, ts(T), when it starts
- DBMS maintains a list of the latest timestamps for data items accessed until commit

If timestamp has already been updated, then abort and restart (with new later timestamp)

not suitable if transactions have lots of conflicts
