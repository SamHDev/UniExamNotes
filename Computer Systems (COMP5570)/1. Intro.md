**Hardware layers**
- combinational logic
- sequential logic
- the fetch/execute cycle

**Software layers**
- machine code
- assembly language
- a stack-based virtual machine
- a high-level language and simple operating system


### Operating System
- A program that deals with other programs
	- load them into memory
	- run them 
	- (+ maybe pause, resume, stopâ€¦.)
	- share Input/Output devices between them
- potentially many users, many programs
- Programs are data in memory! So we can write programs to read/write/change them!
