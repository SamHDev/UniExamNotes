#### No Time Woo!
Ignoring the Issue of time, the computation is "instant".
This style of gate logic is sometimes called: 
- time-independent logic
- **combinational logic**

#### Issues
Abstractions:
- must maintain state
- computation over time
Implementation:
- physical time delays between chips


#### Time Behaviour 
- Discrete - unit to unit (fixed)
- Time delays - physical delays 
	- propagation
	- computation

The clock cycle is designed to prevent issues with time delays.
The cycle length is slightly longer than the time delays

#### Combinational vs Sequential
- Combinational logic is a pure function, returning the present input only
- Sequential logic may create a memory effect, optionally returning the current input or a history of the input.

### Data Flip Flops

- Remembers a state
- `out(t) = in(t- 1)`
- built from nand gates

```
CHIP DFF {
	IN data, clock, read, set;
}
```
