#### The Symbols
- `^` - And
- `v` - Or
- `¬` - Not
- 

#### The Basics
1. `A ^ ¬A = F`
2. `A v ¬A = T`
3. `¬¬A = A` (Double Negative)
4. `A v B = B v A`
5. `A ^ (B v C) = (A v B) ^ (A v C)`
6. `A ^ A = A`

#### De Morgan’s Laws
1. `¬(A v B) = (¬A) ^ (¬B)`
2. `¬(A ^ B) = (¬A) v (¬B)`
3. 


### NAND Proofs

> Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing And, Or And Not operations
> 
> *Use the truth table to Boolean expression method*

> Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing And and Not operations.
> 
> `(x Or y) = Not(Not(x) And Not(y))`

> Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing Nand operations only.
> 
> `Not(x) = (x Nand x)`
> `(x And y) = Not(x Nand y)`
