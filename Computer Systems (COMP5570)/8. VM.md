Java/Jack
- Compiles to Bytecode
- Executes on any architecture
- 2-tier compilation 

### Stack
- you can push and pop from the stack.
- performing an operation pops argument(s) from the stack, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
- Take high-level instructions to lower-level stack operations
- the stack machine is also an abstraction

### Jack of all Trades

##### Operators
| Command | Operation | Returns |
| - | - | - |
| `add` | `x + y` | `integer`
| `sub` | `x - y` | `integer` |
| `neg` | `-x` | `integer` |
| `eq` | `x == y` | `boolean` |
| `gt` | `x > y` | `boolean` |
| `lt` | `x < y` | `boolean` |
| `and` | `x and y` | `boolean` |
| `or` | `x or y` | `boolean` |
| `not` | `not x` | `boolean` |

> `<=` and `>=` are missing
>
> Both `and` and `or` are fully evaluating.

##### Variables
- Arguments
- Local
- Static

Each of these have virtual memory segments

```
push local
push static index
push argument index
push consant index
```

These symbols are references to virtual memory segments



### Memory Layout
```
 0 | SP
 1 | LCL
 2 | ARG
 3 | THIS
 4 | THAT
 5 | ---
.. |    TEMP
12 | ---

13 | R13 ---- 
14 | R14     General purpose registers
15 | R15 ----

16 | ----
...       STATIC
255| ----

256| Stack

```

### Jack VM Code

#### Operations & Segments
- Operations on local variables are in the  `local` segment.
- Operations on arguments variable are in the  `argument` segment.
- Operations on the field variables are in the `this` segment.
- Operations on array entries are in the `that` segment.

Statics are stored from `16`-`255` are referenced with a label `Foo.i`
```
// pop static 5
@Foo.5
M = D
```


```
pop static i
pop constant i
pop/push local pos
pop/push argument pos
pop/push temp 0-5
pop/push this pos
pop/push that pos
pop/push pointer 0:this | 1:that

goto <label>
if-goto <label>
label <label>

call <function>
function <function>
return

add
sub
etc..
```

### Abstraction `->` Implemation

##### VM implementation (handling call):
1. Saves the caller’s frame
	1. return address   (via label)
	2. LCL
	3. ARG
	4. THIS
	5. THAT
2. Sets ARG
3. Jumps to execute foo

##### VM implementation (handling function):
1. Sets up the local segment  
of the called function


##### VM implementation (handling return):
1. Copies the return value onto argument 0
	`*ARG`
2. Sets SP for the caller
	`ARG + 1`
3. Restores the segment pointers of the caller
4. Jumps to the return address within the caller’s code
5. (note that the stack space between old and new sp is recycled)
