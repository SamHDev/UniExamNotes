In Von Neumann, Memory is one address space. Clashes can (and will) happen
- one Memory input 
- one Memory output

#### Solution: multiplex

Multiplex with a (fetch / execute bit).
- Signify `instruction address` vs `data address`

Instruction Register
- load on fetch a bit
- pull from memory output!

Both Data and instruction can go to the ALU!


#### Harvard Architecture
- Variant of von Neumann Architecture
- Two physically separate memory units
	- Instruction memory
	- Data memory
	- Each can be addressed and manipulated separately, and simultaneously

Complication is avoided, but you **fix size** of **multiple** chips
