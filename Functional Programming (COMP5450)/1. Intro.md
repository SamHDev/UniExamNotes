- Programming languages provide abstraction
	- “detail hiding”
	- “managing complexity

### What is functional programming?
- Computation organised around mathematical functions
- Data driven
- Functions are data
- static types and role of side effects

Imperative - Sequence of statements
Expressions - Only expressions and definitions in FP

### Syntax
- Intermediate definitions
```haskell
quad x = 
	let sqr x = x ^ 2
	in sqr x * sqr x
	
quad x = 
	sqr x * sqr x
	where sqr x = x ^ 2
```
- Ordering of definitions is irrelevant

- Data “constructors”
	- `0, 1, 2, …`
	- `0.0, 1.0, 0.2, … c`
	- `True, False`

```
f x = case x of
	0 -> e1
	1 -> e2
	n -> e3

f 0 = e1
f 1 = e2
f n = e3
```

### Type Names!
- `Bool`
- `Integer`
- `String`
- `Char`
- ``
- `() Unit`
- `(a, b) Pair`
- `(a, b, c) Tripple`
  
- `IO a`

### Functions
- `zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]`
- `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`
- `filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`
- `foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b`

```
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b I

myFoldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b 
myFoldr h b [] = b 
myFoldr h b (x:xs) = h x (myFoldr h b xs)

h = function, a = item, b = folded value
```


```
data Colours = R | G | B deriving Show
data ColoursX = R | G | B | RGB Integer Integer Integer
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

type String = [Char];

data BTree a = Leaf | Node { node :: a, left :: BTree a, right :: BTree a }
```


##### IO.
IO is 

- `(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b`
- `(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b`
- `return :: a -> IO a`
- `do {}`



- Functions as data (functions as input = higher-order functions)
- Anonymous functions (lambda)

- Haskell’s semantics is lazy (“call-by-need”)
```haskell
let x = -- expensive computation in x + x
in x + x
-- ^   ^ use value of x (calc once)
```


### Polymorphic types
```haskell
a -> a    -- one implementation

(a, a) -> a -- two implementations
	\(x, y) -> x
	\(x, y) -> y

(a, a) -> (a, a) -- four implementations
	\(x, y) -> (x, y)
	\(x, y) -> (y, x)
	\(x, y) -> (x, x)
	\(x, y) -> (y, y)

a -> b -- zero implementations
-- Cannot make a value that works for all types b


```


### Tail recursion
- Recurse with no further computation on the result
```haskell
length :: [a] -> Integer
length xs = lengthT 0 xs

lengthT :: Integer -> [a] -> Integer
lengthT acc [] = acc
lengthT acc (x : xs) = lengthT (1 + acc) xs
--                             ^^^^^^^^^ computation here
```


### Type Bounds
```haskell
max :: Ord a => a -> a -> a

data Example = Instance;

class Foo
	foo :: a -> a

instance Foo Example where
	foo = ()

```


### Monad
```haskell
class Monad m where
	return :: m a
	(>>=) :: m a -> (a-> m b) -> m b
	
	
```

### Concurrency
```haskell
forkIO :: IO () -> IO ThreadId


foo :: () -> IO ()
foo _ = do {
	putStrLn "fuck"
}

forkIO (foo ())


```

- parameter is an IO action; this action is executed concurrently, possibly in parallel
- forkIO itself finishes almost instantly, returning the thread identifier of the forked off process (very much like spawn in Erlang)
- the actual thread identifier is of limited use in Haskell (can use it to kill a thread though)

##### Communication
- Haskell's processes are more basic; to communicate they need to have access to communication means. Note that communication in Haskell is typed

- `Chan a`
	- a channel to which "messages" (=values) of type a can be written to and read from
- `MVar a`
	- a one value buffer with safe concurrent access; the actual primitive


```haskell
newChan :: IO (Chan a)

readChan :: Chan a -> IO a

writeChan :: Chan a -> a -> IO()
```


### Protocols
- use channels as response types
```haskell
data Message a = 
	Add a (Chan ()) |
	Map(a->a) (Chan ()) |
	Index Int (Chan (Maybe a)) |
	Retrieve (Chan [a])

listM :: [a] -> Chan (Message a) -> IO ()
```

### CFSM
- CFSMs are a model people use to study how a system of concurrent processes interacts
- Each process is associated with one automaton, and typically one dedicated input channel 
- The whole system is meant to view the lot of them as "composed in parallel" •
- to study the interaction we give each CFSM their own data to manage, and check how much overall behaviour can vary

> A set of CFSMs with unique names is called a system, e.g.

- A system configuration: set of configurations for each machine 
- Initial configuration: all at start state with empty channels `A (S0, [-])` and `B (C0, [-])` 
- A sequence of system configurations is called a trace
- We’ll write these via a table, e.g.


![[Pasted image 20230517193713.png]]



**Non-determinism and confluence**
- Execution is non-deterministic if there are multiple traces
- Execution is confluent if these multiple traces end in the same state: the values are deterministic
- A program produces non-deterministic values if multiple runs of a program, on the same inputs, produce different outputs


**An updatable variable, as a process**

Strategies for finding bugs via the model
- “Eager send” - Do any possible sends before any receives
- Break sequentiality - “mix it up!”
	Natural tendency is to think sequentially, seek the most interleaving across processes


### Race Conditions
- Two (or more) processes “racing” to change the output
- Different execution order => different value
- Not all non-determinism due to races (e.g., random numbers)

### Strict evaluation
- what most PLs do, even most functional PLs
- whenever you make a function call
	- evaluate the arguments
	- you then proceed to the function - match patterns, creating bindings, etc...
	- run the body of the function

### Lazy evaluation
- when evaluating a function call
- generally does not evaluate the arguments first; they are left unevaluated as so-called `thunks`
- directly proceed to the definition of 𝑓 and try to match our 𝑛 `thunks` to the formal parameters

intermediate evaluation results are called weak head normal forms (whnf), they are: 
- a constructor applied to arguments (possibly thunks) 
- an actual value of a primitive type (numbers, chars, etc.) 
- a function missing an argument (relative to number of args in def) 
- a lamba-abstraction

- build infinite data structures, like `[1,3..]` the list of all positive odd numbers,
- use values before they become available

Black Hole
- self-referential definition
- a recursively defined variable before you have its value
