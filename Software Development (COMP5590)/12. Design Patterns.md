**Object-oriented software engineering**
- Factor objects into classes
- Define class interfaces and inheritance hierarchies
- Identify relationships

**Don’t solve every problem from first principles**
- Reuse solutions
- Particularly patterns of classes and communicating objects

### Elements
- Name – Increases vocabulary and allows design at a higher level, discussion, etc. 
- Problem – When to apply the pattern, conditions that must be met, how to represent the algorithm as objects, etc. 
- Solution – The elements that make up the design, their relationships, collaborations, responsibilities. A template that can be applied in many different situations. 
- Consequences – Results and trade-offs, impact on flexibility, extensibility, and portability.

### Patterns

**Decorator**
Decorators are used to modify the functionality of objects at runtime

**Singleton**
The singleton pattern resticts the instantiation of a class, ensuring only one instance of the class exists.
