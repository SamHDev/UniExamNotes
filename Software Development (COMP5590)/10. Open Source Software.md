- Code of conduct
- Licence

### Free software model
- Built by hackers for hackers
- Pay not with money, but with code 
- Open decisions (rarely the case)

- GPL license requires publishing changes
- LGPL allows linking in proprietary software
- Distributed version control (git)

### Dual licensing model
- Free for hackers, paid otherwise
- Pay with either money or code
- Commercial, but open ownership

- AGPL closes service provider loophole
- Using database forces you to share your code
- Commercial license if you donâ€™t want to

### Consulting model
- Share code and allow all uses
- Find alternative funding source
- Commercial services, training

- MIT, BSD, Apache
- Allow unrestricted use without requirements

### Corporate open source model
- Developer tools should be open
- Supports other profitable business
- Project ownership remains corporate

- MIT, BSD, Apache (again)

### Community open source model
- Free as in free beer (with donations)
- Is this sustainable?
