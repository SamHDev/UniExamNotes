## Cultures

**Mathematical culture**
- Mathematical proofs 
- Abstract data types 
- Structured programming

**Managerial culture**
- Control the workforce 
- Structured management of teams 
- Requirements and specifications

**Focus: engineers or managers**
- Engineer: focus on tools and code 
- Manager: focus on team structure and bureaucracy

**Focus: product or process**
- Product: work based on a specification
- Process: continually adapt as work goes on

### Waterfall methodology
- Focused on Product and Manager
- Inflexiable
- Multistage

1. Gather Requirements
2. Analyze and design
3. Programing
4. Testing
5. Deployment

## Cleanroom methodology
- Work with an exact specifcation
- Results in high reliability software 
- Relies on formal verification and methods

### Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3)
- Rapid software development
- Focused on Process and Engineering 
- Failed attempts
- Rolled Back :lol: 

### Extreme Programming
- Driven by Engineering Practices 
- Programming in pairs allows for extensive code review
- Frequent releases
- All code has tests (TDD)
- Don't implement features until they are needed (YAGNI)
- Makes use of Continuous Integration
- Heavy reliance on (frequent) communication

### SCRUM methodology
- Manager and process oriented
- Empirical process

###### Encapsulates Three Pillars 
- **Transparency:** Everybody knows what’s going on
- **Inspection**: Check your work as you are doing it
- **Adaptation**: Adjust the direction when needed

> **Manifesto for Agile Software Development (2001)**
> 
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. 
> 
> Through this work we have come to value: 
> • Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> • Working software over comprehensive documentation
> • Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> • Responding to change over following a plan 
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


## SCRUM Development

#### The Team
- Product Owner
	- customer representative
	- defines stories
	- prioritizes tasks
	- business focused
-  Scrum Master
	- process facilitator
	- mentors team
	- removes obstacles
	- controls process
- Development Team
	- cross-functional team
	- contribute to:
		- coding 
		- testing 
		- debugging
		- planning
- Executives
	- usually just get in the way
	- needed for the money

#### The Concepts
- **Backlog** of user stories to implement
- **Planning** based on value × effort
- **Sprints** add functionality in one to two weeks

> “With scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces” — Megan Cook, Atlassian

##### Product Backlog
- an ordered list of tasks needed to complete the project
- can be **Refined** by breaking down big tasks into smaller tasks (Refinement)
- has a **Product Goal** which describes the future state of the product that the team is aiming for

#### The Ceremonies
- Daily Scrum meeting
	- Stand-Up (15 mins)
	- What you did yesterday
	- Tasks for today
	- Blockers
- **Planning** tasks for next sprint
- **Review** and engage with stakeholders
- **Retrospective** to continuously improve

#### The Planning
- Decide the **what** and **how** of a sprint
	What: Product owner describes a goal, and the backlog items for that goal
	Scrum team decides the subset of that goal for the sprint
	How: Development team works out how to actually do the work for goal.
- The backlog is broken down into smaller tasks (refinement)
- Only tasks small enough can be scheduled for a sprint
- The main goal is the backlog, selection of the goal for the sprint.

#### The Charts & Boards

- Burndown charts show `work left vs time`
	- remaining work is on the y-axis
	- sprint time is on the x-axis
-  Workflow Boards - Visualise workflow through columns
	- Tasks move through steps
	- Invented in Japan in the late 1940s at Toyota
- Road Map
	- flexible plan of action for achieving your product vision
