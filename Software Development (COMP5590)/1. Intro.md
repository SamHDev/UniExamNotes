### Plan-driven vs Agile Processes

**Plan-driven processes**
- process activities are planned in advance
- progress is measured against this plan

**Agile processes**
- planning is incremental
- easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements
- Rapid delivery and deployment
- Requirements change quickly in changing business environment
- Plan-driven processes have substantial overheads, e.g. documentation

### Software Process Models

**The Waterfall model**
- Separate and distinct phases of specification and development
- Plan-driven model

**Incremental development**
- Specification, development and validation are inter-leaved
- May be plan-driven or agile

**Reuse-oriented software engineering**
- The system is assembled from existing components
- May be plan-driven or agile

**Extreme Programming**
- Perhaps the best-known and most influential agile method
- Extreme Programming (XP) takes an “extreme” approach to incremental development
	- lots of iteration, multiple versions per day
	- increments are delivered to customers quickly (every 2 weeks)
	- testing builds is a requirement.
- focus on programming rather than planning

**Pair Programing**
- Programmers working in pairs with XP
	- Sitting/Working together to develop
	- Parings may change over time
- Common ownership of code
- Spreads knowlage across a team
- Better collective responsibility for issues
- Can work as an informal review process.
- Encourages refactoring

> Measurements suggest that development productivity with pair programming is similar to that of two people working independently

### Collecting Requirements 

- Requirements expressed as user stories, written on story cards 
-  Development team breaks these down into tasks 
- Customer prioritises stories 
- A few stories for next release chosen 
- Later stories may change or be discarded

### Refactoring 
- Re-organisation of a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code 
- Tidying up and renaming attributes and methods to make them easier to understand 
- The replacement of inline code with calls to methods that have been included in a program library
