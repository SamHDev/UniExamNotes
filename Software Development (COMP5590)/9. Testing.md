**Verification**
Software conforms to specification. Defect testing to check for bugs.

**Validation**
Software does what user wants. Validation testing to check requirements


### TDD
1. Write tests to capture requirements
2. Implement code satisfying tests
3. Test automatically and frequently

### Red, Green, Refactor
1. think about what you want to develop
2. think about how to make your tests pass
3. think about how to improve your existing implementation

> When you write a test, it will initially fail (red). After, you will write the code to make the test pass (green). Eventually, you will update/modify the code while making sure the tests still pass (refactor).

### Black-box
- "functional"
- Without looking at the code 
- Tests based only on specification
- Focuses on representative inputs

### White-box
- "structural"
- Access to the code structure
- Test based on program logic
- Cover as much code as possible

### Equivalence classes
What are some valid/invalid inputs to the function?
