### Modern Software Development
- Multiple Releases Per Day
- Avoid Major Fuck Ups
	- Test major components
	- Don't break core "business logic"
- Small issues are fixed fast

- Built from components and libraries
- You donâ€™t have control over all the code in your software
- Major incidents where library developers break major programs

### Continuous Integration

List of practices for integrating code changes from multiple developers in a software team into the main development branch as early and frequent as possible

**Continuous Delivery**
keep the codebase deployable at any point

**Continuous Deployment**
automatically releases to the production environment

### Projects

**Ensuring Good Project State**
- Make sure "master" branch always works
- Everything builds on a clean machine
- All tests run automatically and pass

**Modern Project Structure**
- Quality Code and Tests.
- Dependency management
- Build configuration - build and run with one command
- Continuous integration - tool configuration

**Bug Tracking**
- User informs developer about a problem
- Developer has to reproduce problem, isolate circumstances, locate and fix and finally deliver fix to user
- For a tiny project a simple problem list document may do
