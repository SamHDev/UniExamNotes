## Structured Programming

Structured programming is procedural

#### The Concepts
- Sequence
- Selection
- Iteration

#### The Rules
**Single Exit Point**
function/method should only ever return from one location. In other words, there should only be a single exit point.

**Early Exit**
- Guards
- Exceptions
- Shorter methods

**Unnecessary Nesting**
- Loops within loops

**Keep program logic simple**
- Unnecessary conditionals

**Remove Duplicate Code**
- longer and harder to read
- further changes harder
- more likely to introduce errors
- makes bug fixes harder, because changes need to be made in multiple places
- Avoid duplicate code by factoring it: new method, class, etc.

## Style
