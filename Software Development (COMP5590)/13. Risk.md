**Risk:** Possibility of loss.

**Loss**
- Not meeting a specified requirement
- Low quality of the end product
- Increased costs
- Delayed completion
- Failure to deliver

**Managing Risk**
- Dealing with risks
- Anticipate potential risks
- Evaluate/rank risks
- Risk mitigation

**Risk vs Opportunity**
- Risk is not always bad (if controlled)
- Balance trade-offs
	- possible negative consequences of risk
	- potential benefits of its associated opportunity
-  Failure is often a key part of learning

### Types of Risk

**Objective risk**
- Derived by science and statistics
- Depends on the accuracy of the models employed

**Subjective risk**
As perceived by the general public

**Risk Attributes**
- Description
- Probability
- Severity
- Mitigation (Plan, `<Actor, Action>`)
- Priority

### Sources of Risk

**Design**
- Erroneous, incomplete, or inconsistent requirements
- Fundamental misconception or flaws in the design or specification
- Analysis based on false assumptions
	- physical world
	- operating environment
	- human behaviour
- Hidden dependencies

**Development**
- Program bugs
- Accidental or intentional use of malicious code
- Poor programming languages, faulty compilers and debuggers, misleading development tools
- Incomplete testing, erroneous verification, mistakes in debugging
- Introduction of new flaws in attempt to fix old flaws

**Deployment**
- Environmental factors
- Infrastructure factors
- Faulty maintenance after installation
- Software misbehaviour
- Human limitations in system use
	- Unintentional misuse (errors)
	- Intentional misuses (breaches, attacks)

### Software Project Risk
**Management Responsibility**
-  Planning, staffing, tracking, quality assurance and configuration management
- constraints on resources, external interfaces, supplier relationships, contract restrictions
- Funding is the most significant project risk reported

**Technical Responsibility **
- Development process - requirements analysis, design, code and test
- Involves both intermediate and final work product
- Requirements stability, design performance, code complexity, and test specifications (acceptance)
- Requirements is the most significant product risk

### Common Risks
- Personnel shortfalls
- Unrealistic schedules and budgets
- Developing wrong functionality
- Stream of requirements changes
- Shortfalls in external components and tasks


### Risk Exposure
`Risk = Likelihood x Impact`
`RE = P(UO) x L(UO)`

> Impact is the effect of an unsatisfactory outcome.
> Likelihood is the probability that a consequence will occur.
