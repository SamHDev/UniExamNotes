### Modulus
`a mod n`

Arithmetic modulo 
- maths and shit 
- Arithmetic before mod

If a and b are any integers, and n is a positive integer, then:
```
a + b mod n = (a mod n) + (b mod n) mod n 
a − b mod n = (a mod n) − (b mod n) mod n
a × b mod n = (a mod n) × (b mod n) mod n
```

#### Cryptology.
- Cryptology - Methods for ‘breaking’ codes
- Cryptography - Devising codes that are resistant to cryptanalysis—and, ideally, can be proved to resist cryptanalysis.

##### Scope.
- Confidentiality/secrecy - Even if the communication medium is insecure, nobody other than Bob should be able to read Alice’s message.
- Authentication - Bob should be able to satisfy himself that the message does indeed come from Alice.
- Integrity - Bob should be able to check that Alice’s message has not been modified during transmission, either accidentally or deliberately.
- Source - nonrepudiation Alice should not be able to deny sending the message.
- Destination - nonrepudiation Bob should not be able to deny receiving the message.
- Signatures - Bob should be able to convince a third party (e.g. Charlie) that the message originated from Alice. This is a stronger version of authentication.

##### Caesar Cipher
Julius Caesar used a cipher in which each letter of the (ancient) Latin alphabet was replaced by the letter three places on:

- `c = p + k mod 26`
- `p = c − k mod 26`

##### Substitution Ciphers
The following features of English make substitution ciphers vulnerable to cryptanalysis:
- Widely different letter frequencies. E, T, and A are particularly common; J, X, Q and Z are rare.
- A single-letter word is very likely to be A or I.
- Some letters are rarely or never doubled: A, H, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y.

The **Vigenère cipher** is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.

The idea of a transposition cipher is to create the ciphertext by rearranging the letters in the plaintext. At its simplest, you could for example for the ciphertext by putting all the odd-numbered letters of the plaintext first (in order), followed by all the even-numbered letters. 
So for example `MEETMEINSTLOUIS` would encrypt as: `MEMISLUSETENTOI`



We can make Vigenère ciphers much more secure if: 
- we use a key as long as the message;
- choose the letters of the key completely randomly—as if drawn from an urn like a lottery, except that each letter is put back in the urn after being drawn; 
- use the key only once. 

Such a cipher is called a one-time pad: it is unbreakable provided the key is secure.



### Prime (not the shitty drink)
A prime number is an integer greater than one that is not divisible by any integer apart from itself and one. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29

### Security
##### Unconditional Security
An encryption scheme is said to be unconditionally secure if 
- the ciphertext it generates provides an adversary with no information about the corresponding plaintext, even if the adversary has unlimited computing resources, and access to unlimited amounts of ciphertext.


##### Computational Security
An encryption scheme is said to be computationally secure if either:
- The computational cost of breaking the cipher exceeds the value of the encrypted information
- The time required to break the cipher exceeds the useful lifetime of the encrypted information.


### Block Ciphers
- **stream cipher** - one bit, byte or character at a time
- **block cipher** - gathered into blocks of b bits, where b is called the block size

If the number of bits in the plaintext is not an exact multiple of b, the last block is padded out—say with spaces, zero bits, or random bits—before conversion.

##### The Function
- `C = E(P, KE)`
- `P = D(C, KD)`

### Diffusion and Confusion
##### Diffusion
- Localised changes to the plaintext should result in nonlocalised changes to the ciphertext.
- Ideally, in a block cipher, if a single bit of plaintext is changed, about half the bits in the output block should change (and which bits these are should seem random to the cryptanalyst).

##### Confusion
- it should be very difficult to glean information about the key by examining the statistical properties of the ciphertext.
- not true of a simple substitution cipher, where letter frequencies in the ciphertext can lead us straight to the key


### Block Types
#### Electronic Code Book (ECB)

- A particular plaintext block will always encrypt to the same ciphertext block.

#### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
![[Pasted image 20230518234229.png]]


- The initialisation vector VI must be known to both sender and receiver, along with the key K.
- Different values of VI should be used for different messages.

- Encryption cannot be carried out for more than one block in parallel (though decryption can).


#### Counter Mode (CTR)
![[Pasted image 20230518234447.png]]


- may be able to modify the content of the message

### GCD
Roughly it works like this:
1. starting with the pair of numbers (a, b), repeatedly replace the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number. 
2. Carry on until one of the numbers in the pair is zero: then the other number will be the GCD of a and b.
