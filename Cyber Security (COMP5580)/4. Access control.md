- **Authentication** - verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system
	- Something I Know
	- Something I Possess
	- Something I Am
- **Authorization** - whether that entity (person, device, etc.) should be allowed access or not
- **Access control** - allowing or blocking the requests for access/use
	`Access Control = Authentication + Authorisation`

### Password Entropy
- valid chars to power
- `[A-Z]+ = 26n = 4.7n bits`
- If some passwords are more common than others then entropy is lower

- Passwords should be hashed using a "slow" hashing algorithm like bcrypt/scrypt to slow down offline attacks
- Salt should be used when hashing to defeat rainbow tables attacks

### Access Control Approaches
- Discretionary (DAC) (authorisation-based) policies control access based on the identity of the requestor and on access rules stating what requestors are (or are not) allowed to do.
- Mandatory (MAC) policies control access based on mandated regulations determined by a central authority.
- Role-based (RBAC) policies control access depending on the roles that users have within the system and on rules stating what accesses are allowed to users in given roles.
- Attribute-based (ABAC) policies control access depending on the attributes of entities (subject and object), operations, and the environment relevant to a request.


### Symmetric authentication
using the same cryptographic keys for authentication process

**Challenge/Response**
1. server generates challenge
2. client encrypts
3. server is ok

challenge needs to be generated by authenticator

**scalability of symmetric authentication**
`need N*(N-1)/2 secrets` - Scales very poorly (square of N)

#### Key Distrbution
A server generates keys and distribute them in a secure way

##### Needham Schroeder Protocol

1. Alice asks server for a key to Talk to Bob 
2.  Server generates a session key KAB, encrypts with Alice’s master key (KAS) 
3. Gives Alice same key KAB encrypted with Bob’s master key KBS (a "ticket") 
4. Alice forwards Bob’s ticket (encrypted session key) to him
5. Bob decrypts the session key using KBS, obtaining KAB 
6. Bob's sends a challenge (random nonce NB) encrypted with the session key KAB to verify Alice identity 
7. Alice decrypts the nonce, does a simple operation on it, and sends it back, encrypted again with the session key


- Man in the middle attack (MITM) Charlie can impersonate Bob (note, message never reaches Bob)
- To prevent that we need to have Bob identity (B) be part of the server response to Alice

##### problems with symmetric authentication
- Lots of secrets
- Eavesdropping these initial communications, or hacking the secure storage blows the whole thing
- improves scalability, but doesn't solve it


### Asymmetric Authentication.
- Asymmetric Authentication builds on Asymmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric Encryption = Different keys

Can use the keys either way round: 
- Encrypt with the public key, and only the person with the private key can read the message
- Encrypt with the private key, and anyone with the public key can decrypt it, but they can be sure that it was the private key holder that wrote it

- Asymmetric encryption is much, much slower L • Estimates of 1000 times slower for some


### Hashing
- A hashing function takes any arbitrary message, and gives us a fixed length string of random-looking letters and numbers
- Like a digital fingerprint of the message

### Distributing Public Keys
- The trusted third party has a public key known to everyone
- Trusted third party is a Certificate Authority
- Get a certified key from a public repository

- Monopoly Model - Just one trusted entity
- Oligarchy - Many root CAs, like we have in browsers
- Anarchy (Web of Trust) - everyone can sign everyone else’s certificates – a friend can sign another friend’s certificate to ‘validate’ that friend’s identity.

A certificate authority can sign a certificate for someone else, saying they do a good job at checking other people, so they too can issue certificates.

We talk about chains of certificates, which means that a certificate saying K is Alice’s public key is signed by C, and their certificate is signed by D, all the way up to a root CA


Two main certificate formats in use today:
- X.509 - Signed by a single certification authority
- PGP - Allows multiple owners for a key



### Types of Security Controls
- Preventative 
	- controls intended to stop an unauthorized or undesired incident from occurring.
	- E.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, employee vetting
- Detective
	- controls intended to detect that an unauthorised or undesired incident has occurred
	- intrusion detection systems, system audit logs, CCTV
- Reactive 
	- controls intended to support a response to an unauthorised or undesired incident that has occurred.
	- recovery systems
