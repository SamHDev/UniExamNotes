- an encryption algorithm developed by Horst Feistel at IBM in 1971, and used by Lloyds Bank to secure ATMs

- Key size reduced from LUCIFERâ€™s 128 bits to 56 bits, apparently so DES could be implemented on a single chip;
- NSA proposed changes to the design of the S-boxes. Were these to ensure that the US government could decrypt traffic?
