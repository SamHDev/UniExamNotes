Another class of search problems is identification problems
- Solutions are assignments to variables
- The goal itself is important, not the path
- All paths at the same depth (for some formulations)
- CSPs are a specialised class of identification problems - specialised algorithms


### Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- Variables
- Domains
- Constraints
- Solutions :)

##### Example
![[Pasted image 20230516201324.png]]


##### Binary CSP
- each constraint relates (at most) two variables
- uses binary constraint graph
- General-purpose CSP algorithms use the graph structure to speed up search.

### Varieties of CSPs
#### Discrete Variables

##### Finite domains
- Size `d` means `O(d^n)` complete assignments
- E.g., Boolean CSPs, including Boolean satisfiability
- 
##### Infinite domains 
- integers, strings, etc...
- job scheduling, variables are start/end times for each job
- Linear constraints solvable, nonlinear undecidable

#### Continuous Variables
- E.g, start/end times for Hubble Telescope observations
- Linear constraints solvable in polynomial time by LP methods

### Varieties of Constraints
- Unary constraints involve a single variable (equivalent to reducing domains)
- Binary constraints involve pairs of variables
- Higher-order constraints involve 3 or more variables
- Preferences (soft constraints)
	- Often representable by a cost for each variable assignment
	- Gives constrained optimization problems

### Backtracking Search:
Backtracking search is the basic uninformed algorithm for solving CSPs

- One variable at a time
	- Variable assignments are commutative, so fix ordering
- Check constraints as you go
	- As soon as we violate a constraint, we can backtrack
	- Might have to do some computation to check the constraints
- Depth-first search with these two improvements is called backtracking search


#### Filtering

**Forward Checking**
- Can we detect inevitable failure early?
- Keep track of remaining legal values for unassigned variables
- Terminate search direction when a variable has no legal values

**Constraint Propagation**
- Forward checking propagates information from assigned to unassigned variables, but doesn’t provide early detection for all failures:
- Enforcing consistency of arcs pointing to each new assignment
- A simple form of propagation that makes sure all arcs are consistent.

After enforcing arc consistency:
- Can have one solution left
- Can have multiple solutions left
- Can have no solutions left (and not know it)

**Increasing degrees of consistency**
- 1-Consistency (Node Consistency): 
	Each single node’s domain has a value which meets that node’s unary constraints
- 2-Consistency (Arc Consistency): 
	For each pair of nodes, any consistent assignment to one can be extended to the other 
- `K`-Consistency:
	For each k nodes, any consistent assignment to `k − 1` can be extended to the `k`-th node.

Higher k more expensive to compute

#### Ordering
##### Variable Ordering - Minimum remaining values
- Choose the variable with the **fewest** legal left values in its domain
- most constrained variable
- Fail-fast ordering

Because we will have to assign every variable. If there is a problem in the assignment, and we will have to backtrack at some point, it is better to backtrack now, locally

##### Value Ordering: The Least Constraining Value
- Given a choice of variable, choose the least constraining value
- the one that rules out the fewest values in the remaining variables

We do not have to assign every value, so it is better to pick values that are more likely to work out

### Tree-Structured CSPs
- A constraint graph is a tree if any two variables are connected by exactly one path (no loops).
- A CSP whose constraint graph is a tree is said to be tree-structured.
- Solved in `O(nd^2 )` time

###### The Steps
- Choose a root variable
- Order variables linearly so that parents precede children

- Remove illegal values backward
	- `For i = n, . . . , 2, apply MakeArcConsistent(Parent(Xi), Xi)`

- Assign forward
	- `For i = 1, . . . , n, assign Xi consistently with Parent(Xi)`
