- Nature as a source of inspiration to problem-solving methods

1.  create initial population
2.  compute fitness
3.  select best individuals (based on fitness)
4.  modify best individuals, producing offspring
5.  repeat to step 2


### Simple Genetic Algorithm
- Requires some representation (e.g. bit string)
- Proportionate selection, simulating a Roulette Wheel
- Simple genetic operators (to produce offspring):

- Single Point Crossover
- Multi Point Crossover
- Single Point Mutation
- Swap

> Mutation is dangerous, but it is useful to have in case there is premature convergence
> 
> Hence, genetic diversity via mutation is required to introduce noise in the gene pool in order to perturb the gene pool and get the optimal solution
