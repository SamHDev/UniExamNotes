#### Boids Model
- separation - avoid collisions with nearby boids
- alignment - match the direction and velocity with nearby boids
- cohesion - move towards the centre of the nearby boids, to stay close to them

### Properties of Complex Systems
- Simple components/agents (bird, ant, neuron, etc)
- Local, non-linear interactions among agents
- No central control (system is formed through self-organization)
- Emergent intelligent behaviour at the system level
	- Information processing
	- Complex dynamics
	- Evolution and learning

# Swarm Intelligence.
Swarm intelligence consists of a set of algorithms, inspired by the behaviour of natural swarms

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- population-based algorithm
	- maintain a population of particles
	- a particle represents a candidate solution to the given problem
	- a particle is similar to an individual in the genetic algorithm (GA)
- a particle has a position and a velocity in the search space
- position of each particle is evaluated by a fitness function
- each particle interacts with its neighbours
- each particle ‚Äúlearns‚Äù by adjusting its position and velocity

##### A Moving Particle
particle `i` at time `t`
	- position `ùë•ùëñ (ùë°) 
	- velocity `ùë£ùëñ (ùë°)

Has an:
- inertia component
- cognitive component
- social component

1. create initial population
2. compute fitness of each particle
3. update the personal best position of each particle, and the global best position of the population
4. update position and velocity of each particle
5. return to step 2


### ACO
##### Foraging Behaviour of Ants.
- Ants move around randomly to search for food
- When they find food, they carry food back and drop pheromone along the way from the food source to their nest
- Other ants follow the pheromone trails to reach the food source 
- As they carry food back to the nest, they drop more pheromone on the path (reinforcement)
- As food source is gradually depleted, the pheromone trail becomes weaker and eventually disappears (evaporation)

##### implicit feedback method ‚Äì user navigation pattern
- each user performs a greedy search for a local optimal path
- users only click the FAQs that may lead to the answer of their inquiry
- frequently visited FAQs accumulate more scores
- each time a FAQ is visited, its timestamp updates with the most recent visiting time
- every month, all FAQs are checked and those without recent visit have their scores decreased


### Swarm-based Clustering Algorithm

1. unloaded ant randomly lands on a data point
2. ant makes a decision whether to move this data point to another location
	- isolated data point or dissimilar to surrounding data points
	1. loaded ant randomly moves to another location
	2. ant makes a decision whether to drop the data point at this location
- otherwise move

- each agent (artificial ant) follows simple rules, only interacting with the data points in its local area
- dissimilar or isolated data points have higher probability to be picked up and dropped close to the data points similar to them
- at the global level, clusters form spontaneously
