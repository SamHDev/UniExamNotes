- Games have uncertainty due to the presence of opponent
- Sometimes large branching factors prevent standard search methods

- perfect information: all the information about the environment
- imperfect information: some aspect of play is hidden
- Perfect decisions: possible to predict subsequent moves

##### Game Definition:
- The initial state, ie. the board position, whose turn it is, etc
- A set of operators, legal moves which can be made.
- A terminal test and terminal state(s) (determines when the game is over).
- A utility function, numeric calculation of a game outcome. For chess, the outcome is a win, loss, or draw.

### Min-Max
1. Generate the whole game tree
2. Apply the utility function to each terminal state to get its value
	- Backtracking - Determine the utility of the nodes higher up in the search tree
	-  Continue backtracking from the leaf nodes toward the root
3. Once reaching root
	1. MAX chooses the move that leads to the highest value
	2. MIN chooses the move that leads to the lowest value


##### Properties of Minimax
- Complete: Yes, if tree is finite
- Optimal: Yes, against an optimal opponent
- Complexity: `O(b^m)`

##### Resource limits
When the tree calculation is not fast enough, we use imperfect decisions
- cut off at a certain limit
- Then use evaluation function for estimated desirability of position
	- An approximation to the utility used in minimax
	- Evaluation is based on the current state information at cut-off

##### Evaluation functions
- An evaluation function returns an estimate of the expected utility of the game from a given position
- If the board evaluation is high for a player, it will be low for the opponent


### A-B Pruning
- Essential idea is to stop searching down a branch of the tree when you can determine that itâ€™s a dead end
- Alpha-beta pruning produces the same solution as minimax without pruning, assuming it uses the same evaluation function
- It avoids looking at nodes that cannot influence the final decision

> a = highest-value found at any point of current path for MAX
> (initial value for a = - infinity)
> 
> b = lowest-value found at any point of current path for MIN
> (initial value for b = +infinity)

- DFS each leaf
- Find the smallest branch for node, update b
- if b is smaller than a then use that branch
- recurse value to, and continue DFS

- Pruning does not affect the final result
- Guaranteed to compute same root value as Minimax
