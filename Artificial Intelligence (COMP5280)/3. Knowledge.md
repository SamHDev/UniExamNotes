### Knowledge representation (KR)
- how knowledge and facts about the world can be represented
- what kind of reasoning can be done with that knowledge.


#### Natural language
- A dime is better than a nickel.
- A nickel is better than a penny.
- Therefore, a dime is better than a penny

- A penny is better than nothing.
- Nothing is better than world peace

### Propositional logic
- Simplest type of logic
- A proposition is a statement that is either true or false
- Complex constructions

> - “UoK is located in Canterbury.”
> - “It is raining today.”
> - “It is raining outside” and “the traffic in Canterbury is heavy.”


### First order logic
- More complex logic
- Objects, relations, properties are explicit

### Shitty Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Fancy Name |
| - | - | - |
| `⊤` | true | | 
| `⊥` | false | |
| `¬` | not | negation |
| `∧` | and | conjunction |
| `∨` | or | disjunction |
| `→` | if ... then ... | implication |
| `↔` | if and only if | biconditional |


Interpretation: assignment of truth values to propositional symbols.

### Fucking Formulas

A knowledge base is a set of formulas describing constraints on the world.
```
KB = {Rain ∨ Snow, Traffic, Rain → Wet}.
```

A knowledge base KB entails a formula `f`, written `KB |= f`

### Modus Ponens
```
KB = {Rain, Rain → Wet, Wet → Slippery}
KB = {Rain, Rain → Wet, Wet → Slippery, Wet}
KB = {Rain, Rain → Wet, Wet → Slippery, Wet, Slippery}
```
