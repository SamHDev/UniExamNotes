Abstraction: the process of removing detail from a representation.
Search: the process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches the goal.

The robot is in a **start** state, it has a set of deterministic **actions** it can carry out, and wants to get to a **goal** state.

### Search Problems
- A state space
	a state contains all/only information necessary to predict the effects of an action and to determine if it is a goal state
- a start state
- a set of actions available in each state
- a successor function with
	given a state and an action, returns next state
- a goal test
	goal(s) is true when s is a goal state

A solution is a sequence of actions to a goal state.
	optimal solution: solution with minimal associated cost


### State Space Graph
- a mathematical representation of a search problem.
- nodes are (abstracted) states
- edges are actions (connect states to successors)
- some nodes are goal nodes

### Search Tree
- a tree of all possible action sequences from the start state.
- the root node is the start state
- children correspond to successors
- nodes correspond to paths to achieve states they are referencing
- Lots of repeated structure
- For most problems can never be constructed (infinite)

##### Generic (Tree) Search Algorithm
- incrementally explore paths from the start nodes
- maintain a frontier of paths that have been explored
- As search proceeds, the frontier expands into the unexplored nodes until a goal state is encountered.
- The way in which the frontier is expanded defines the search/exploration strategy.

##### Search tree parameters: 
- `b` – the branching factor
- `m` – the maximum depth (may be ∞) 
- `d` – depth of the least-cost solution


### Uninformed Search Strategies
##### Depth-First Search
- Strategy - expand a deepest node first 
- Implementation - frontier is a LIFO stack
- always selects one of the last elements added to the frontier

##### Breadth-First Search
- Strategy - expand the shallowest node first 
- Implementation - frontier is a FIFO queue
- always selects one of the earliest elements added to the frontier

##### Performance
**When will BFS outperform DFS? **
- the goal is shallow and to the right of the tree
- finds optimal solution

**When will DFS outperform BFS** 
- there are many goals very deep in the tree 
- memory limitations


##### Uniform Cost Search
- Strategy - expand a cheapest node (with lowest path cost) 
- Implementation - frontier is a priority queue ordered by path cost.
- always selects a path on the frontier with lowest cost

- UCS explores increasing cost contours
- complete and optimal
- but might do a lot of useless work
	- Expands equally in all “directions”
	- Has no information about goal location


### Informed Search Strategies
##### Search Heuristics
use extra knowledge to guide the search towards the goal

**A heuristic is:** 
- A function that estimates how close a state is to a goal 
	 `h(s)`` is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from s to the goal
- Designed for a particular search problem
	`h(s)` needs to be efficient to compute
	quick way of estimating how far the goal is

##### Greedy Search
- Expand the node that seems closest
- greedy search only cares about proximity to goal and ignored cost to get to a state
- Typically goes straight to the (wrong) goal
- In the worst case can explore everything (with poor heuristic)

##### A ∗ Search
- Combining Uniform-Cost and Greedy Search
	- Uniform cost search is steady but slow
	- Greedy search is fast but carefree
-  selects the node on the frontier with the lowest estimated cost of the cheapest solution through that node.
- Expands mainly towards the goal
- Does explore a bit around to ensure optimality

> Uniform cost search orders by path cost, or backward cost `g(n)`
> Greedy search orders by goal proximity, or forward cost `h(n)`
> 
> A ∗ search orders by the sum: `f (n) = g(n) + h(n)``

##### Admissibility
**Inadmissible (pessimistic)**
heuristics break optimality by trapping good plans on the frontier

**Admissible (optimistic)**
heuristics slow down bad plans but never overestimate true costs


### Heuristic Design
- complete 
- optimal 
- no need to revisit states
- consistent
