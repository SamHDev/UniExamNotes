e.g.
- Airline Networks
- Internet Network

##### Properties of Network Structure
- The Vast majority of the nodes have very few links
- Very few nodes have many links (hubs)

- Robust to random node failure
- Vulnerable to targeted “hub” failure


### Web Search Engine
PageRank: importance of a web page
- number of received (inward) links
- links received from important web pages

PageRank works so well due to the existence of “hub” structures in the world-wide-web
- a few web pages have many links to them
- vast majority of the web pages have very few links to them

PageRank finds the few “hub” pages among millions of relevant web pages, and put the “hub” pages on the top of the list


```
score = number of links to site / number of total links
M = matrix of score between pages
rank = 1 / number of nodes

iteration:
	new_rank = M * (rank * I)
	rank = df(new_rank) + ((1 - df) / number of nodes)

repeat iteration, until the rank for each node stabilizes

```
