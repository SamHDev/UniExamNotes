- Supervised learning – learns with input and target output/labels
- Reinforcement learning – rewards for correct action
- Unsupervised learning – learns without labels, self-organisation


###### Reinforcement Learning
- Agent isn’t told what the correct actions are
- Agent isn’t told which action caused reward
- Learning through trial-and-error


### Clustering
- Unsupervised classification
- Different from supervised learning - no output labels
- Process of grouping similar objects into groups
- Two or more objects belong to the same cluster if they are “close” according to a given distance (like Euclidean)


#### K-Means
1. Choose K points at random as cluster centres (centroids)
2. Assign each instance to its closest cluster centre using a certain distance measure (usually Euclidean or Manhattan)
3. Calculate the centroid of each cluster, use it as the new cluster centre (one measure of centroid is mean)
4. Go back to Step 2, stop when cluster centres do not change any more

- Relatively efficient
but...
- Significantly sensitive to the initial randomly selected cluster centres
- Does not necessarily find the most optimal configuration
- Applicable only when mean is defined
- Need to specify K, the number of clusters, in advance

### Classification
- Give data with labels
- But we need lots of data

##### Linear Separation
- Can "Linearly" Separate (with `y=mx+c`) classes
- But, in practice, we seldom get linear separable classes where a linear classifier will fail to classify them

##### Nearest Neighbour
- very simple classifier
- classified by calculating the distance to the nearest training data

1. Determine parameter `k` = number of nearest neighbours
2. Calculate the distance between the test data and all the training data
3. Sort the distance and determine nearest neighbours based on the `k`-th minimum distance
4. Gather the labels of category/classes of the nearest neighbours
5. Use simple majority of the category of nearest neighbours to determine the class of the test data

- Robust to noisy training data
- Generally, gives good classification
- easy to implement
